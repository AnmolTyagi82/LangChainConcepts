Introduction\\nReal-time object detection is a very important topic in\\ncomputer vision, as it is often a necessary component in\\ncomputer vision systems. For example, multi-object track-\\ning [94, 93], autonomous driving [40, 18], robotics [35, 58],\\nmedical image analysis [34, 46], etc. The computing de-\\nvices that execute real-time object detection is usually some\\nmobile CPU or GPU, as well as various neural processing\\nunits (NPU) developed by major manufacturers. For exam-\\nple, the Apple neural engine (Apple), the neural compute\\nstick (Intel), Jetson AI edge devices (Nvidia), the edge TPU\\n(Google), the neural processing engine (Qualcomm), the AI\\nprocessing unit (MediaTek), and the AI SoCs (Kneron), are\\nall NPUs. Some of the above mentioned edge devices focus\\non speeding up different operations such as vanilla convolu-\\ntion, depth-wise convolution, or MLP operations. In this pa-\\nper, the real-time object detector we proposed mainly hopes\\nthat it can support both mobile GPU and GPU devices from\\nthe edge to the cloud.\\nIn recent years, the real-time object detector is still de-\\nveloped for different edge device. For example, the devel-\\nFigure 1: Comparison with other real-time object detectors, our\\nproposed methods achieve state-of-the-arts performance.\\nopment of MCUNet [49, 48] and NanoDet [54] focused on\\nproducing low-power single-chip and improving the infer-\\nence speed on edge CPU. As for methods such as YOLOX\\n[21] and YOLOR [81], they focus on improving the infer-\\nence speed of various GPUs. More recently, the develop-\\nment of real-time object detector has focused on the de-\\nsign of efﬁcient architecture. As for real-time object de-\\ntectors that can be used on CPU [54, 88, 84, 83], their de-\\nsign is mostly based on MobileNet [28, 66, 27], ShufﬂeNet\\n[92, 55], or GhostNet [25]. Another mainstream real-time\\nobject detectors are developed for GPU [81, 21, 97], they\\nmostly use ResNet [26], DarkNet [63], or DLA [87], and\\nthen use the CSPNet [80] strategy to optimize the architec-\\nture. The development direction of the proposed methods in\\nthis paper are different from that of the current mainstream\\nreal-time object detectors. In addition to architecture op-\\ntimization, our proposed methods will focus on the opti-\\nmization of the training process. Our focus will be on some\\noptimized modules and optimization methods which may\\nstrengthen the training cost for improving the accuracy of\\nobject detection, but without increasing the inference cost.\\nWe call the proposed modules and optimization methods\\ntrainable bag-of-freebies.\\n1arXiv:2207.02696v1  [cs.CV]  6 Jul 2022', metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\Yolo7.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Recently, model re-parameterization [13, 12, 29] and dy-\\nnamic label assignment [20, 17, 42] have become important\\ntopics in network training and object detection. Mainly af-\\nter the above new concepts are proposed, the training of\\nobject detector evolves many new issues. In this paper, we\\nwill present some of the new issues we have discovered and\\ndevise effective methods to address them. For model re-\\nparameterization, we analyze the model re-parameterization\\nstrategies applicable to layers in different networks with the\\nconcept of gradient propagation path, and propose planned\\nre-parameterized model. In addition, when we discover that\\nwith dynamic label assignment technology, the training of\\nmodel with multiple output layers will generate new issues.\\nThat is: “How to assign dynamic targets for the outputs of\\ndifferent branches?” For this problem, we propose a new\\nlabel assignment method called coarse-to-ﬁne lead guided\\nlabel assignment.\\nThe contributions of this paper are summarized as fol-\\nlows: (1) we design several trainable bag-of-freebies meth-\\nods, so that real-time object detection can greatly improve\\nthe detection accuracy without increasing the inference\\ncost; (2) for the evolution of object detection methods, we\\nfound two new issues, namely how re-parameterized mod-\\nule replaces original module, and how dynamic label as-\\nsignment strategy deals with assignment to different output\\nlayers. In addition, we also propose methods to address the\\ndifﬁculties arising from these issues; (3) we propose “ex-\\ntend” and “compound scaling” methods for the real-time\\nobject detector that can effectively utilize parameters and\\ncomputation; and (4) the method we proposed can effec-\\ntively reduce about 40% parameters and 50% computation\\nof state-of-the-art real-time object detector, and has faster\\ninference speed and higher detection accuracy.\\n2. Related work\\n2.1. Real-time object detectors\\nCurrently state-of-the-art real-time object detectors are\\nmainly based on YOLO [61, 62, 63] and FCOS [76, 77],\\nwhich are [3, 79, 81, 21, 54, 85, 23]. Being able to become\\na state-of-the-art real-time object detector usually requires\\nthe following characteristics: (1) a faster and stronger net-\\nwork architecture; (2) a more effective feature integration\\nmethod [22, 97, 37, 74, 59, 30, 9, 45]; (3) a more accurate\\ndetection method [76, 77, 69]; (4) a more robust loss func-\\ntion [96, 64, 6, 56, 95, 57]; (5) a more efﬁcient label assign-\\nment method [99, 20, 17, 82, 42]; and (6) a more efﬁcient\\ntraining method. In this paper, we do not intend to explore\\nself-supervised learning or knowledge distillation methods\\nthat require additional data or large model. Instead, we will\\ndesign new trainable bag-of-freebies method for the issues\\nderived from the state-of-the-art methods associated with\\n(4), (5), and (6) mentioned above.2.2. Model re-parameterization\\nModel re-parametrization techniques [71, 31, 75, 19, 33,\\n11, 4, 24, 13, 12, 10, 29, 14, 78] merge multiple compu-\\ntational modules into one at inference stage. The model\\nre-parameterization technique can be regarded as an en-\\nsemble technique, and we can divide it into two cate-\\ngories, i.e., module-level ensemble and model-level ensem-\\nble. There are two common practices for model-level re-\\nparameterization to obtain the ﬁnal inference model. One\\nis to train multiple identical models with different train-\\ning data, and then average the weights of multiple trained\\nmodels. The other is to perform a weighted average of the\\nweights of models at different iteration number. Module-\\nlevel re-parameterization is a more popular research issue\\nrecently. This type of method splits a module into multi-\\nple identical or different module branches during training\\nand integrates multiple branched modules into a completely\\nequivalent module during inference. However, not all pro-\\nposed re-parameterized module can be perfectly applied to\\ndifferent architectures. With this in mind, we have devel-\\noped new re-parameterization module and designed related\\napplication strategies for various architectures.\\n2.3. Model scaling\\nModel scaling [72, 60, 74, 73, 15, 16, 2, 51] is a way\\nto scale up or down an already designed model and make\\nit ﬁt in different computing devices. The model scaling\\nmethod usually uses different scaling factors, such as reso-\\nlution (size of input image), depth (number of layer), width\\n(number of channel), and stage (number of feature pyra-\\nmid), so as to achieve a good trade-off for the amount of\\nnetwork parameters, computation, inference speed, and ac-\\ncuracy. Network architecture search (NAS) is one of the\\ncommonly used model scaling methods. NAS can automat-\\nically search for suitable scaling factors from search space\\nwithout deﬁning too complicated rules. The disadvantage\\nof NAS is that it requires very expensive computation to\\ncomplete the search for model scaling factors. In [15], the\\nresearcher analyzes the relationship between scaling factors\\nand the amount of parameters and operations, trying to di-\\nrectly estimate some rules, and thereby obtain the scaling\\nfactors required by model scaling. Checking the literature,\\nwe found that almost all model scaling methods analyze in-\\ndividual scaling factor independently, and even the methods\\nin the compound scaling category also optimized scaling\\nfactor independently. The reason for this is because most\\npopular NAS architectures deal with scaling factors that are\\nnot very correlated. We observed that all concatenation-\\nbased models, such as DenseNet [32] or V oVNet [39], will\\nchange the input width of some layers when the depth of\\nsuch models is scaled. Since the proposed architecture is\\nconcatenation-based, we have to design a new compound\\nscaling method for this model.\\n2', metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\Yolo7.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Figure 2: Extended efﬁcient layer aggregation networks. The proposed extended ELAN (E-ELAN) does not change the gradient transmis-\\nsion path of the original architecture at all, but use group convolution to increase the cardinality of the added features, and combine the\\nfeatures of different groups in a shufﬂe and merge cardinality manner. This way of operation can enhance the features learned by different\\nfeature maps and improve the use of parameters and calculations.\\n3. Architecture\\n3.1. Extended efﬁcient layer aggregation networks\\nIn most of the literature on designing the efﬁcient ar-\\nchitectures, the main considerations are no more than the\\nnumber of parameters, the amount of computation, and the\\ncomputational density. Starting from the characteristics of\\nmemory access cost, Ma et al. [55] also analyzed the in-\\nﬂuence of the input/output channel ratio, the number of\\nbranches of the architecture, and the element-wise opera-\\ntion on the network inference speed. Doll ´aret al. [15] addi-\\ntionally considered activation when performing model scal-\\ning, that is, to put more consideration on the number of el-\\nements in the output tensors of convolutional layers. The\\ndesign of CSPV oVNet [79] in Figure 2 (b) is a variation of\\nV oVNet [39]. In addition to considering the aforementioned\\nbasic designing concerns, the architecture of CSPV oVNet\\n[79] also analyzes the gradient path, in order to enable the\\nweights of different layers to learn more diverse features.\\nThe gradient analysis approach described above makes in-\\nferences faster and more accurate. ELAN [1] in Figure 2 (c)\\nconsiders the following design strategy – “How to design an\\nefﬁcient network?.” They came out with a conclusion: By\\ncontrolling the shortest longest gradient path, a deeper net-\\nwork can learn and converge effectively. In this paper, we\\npropose Extended-ELAN (E-ELAN) based on ELAN and\\nits main architecture is shown in Figure 2 (d).\\nRegardless of the gradient path length and the stacking\\nnumber of computational blocks in large-scale ELAN, it has\\nreached a stable state. If more computational blocks are\\nstacked unlimitedly, this stable state may be destroyed, and\\nthe parameter utilization rate will decrease. The proposedE-ELAN uses expand, shufﬂe, merge cardinality to achieve\\nthe ability to continuously enhance the learning ability of\\nthe network without destroying the original gradient path.\\nIn terms of architecture, E-ELAN only changes the archi-\\ntecture in computational block, while the architecture of\\ntransition layer is completely unchanged. Our strategy is\\nto use group convolution to expand the channel and car-\\ndinality of computational blocks. We will apply the same\\ngroup parameter and channel multiplier to all the compu-\\ntational blocks of a computational layer. Then, the feature\\nmap calculated by each computational block will be shuf-\\nﬂed into ggroups according to the set group parameter g,\\nand then concatenate them together. At this time, the num-\\nber of channels in each group of feature map will be the\\nsame as the number of channels in the original architec-\\nture. Finally, we add ggroups of feature maps to perform\\nmerge cardinality. In addition to maintaining the original\\nELAN design architecture, E-ELAN can also guide differ-\\nent groups of computational blocks to learn more diverse\\nfeatures.\\n3.2. Model scaling for concatenation-based models\\nThe main purpose of model scaling is to adjust some at-\\ntributes of the model and generate models of different scales\\nto meet the needs of different inference speeds. For ex-\\nample the scaling model of EfﬁcientNet [72] considers the\\nwidth, depth, and resolution. As for the scaled-YOLOv4\\n[79], its scaling model is to adjust the number of stages. In\\n[15], Doll ´aret al. analyzed the inﬂuence of vanilla convolu-\\ntion and group convolution on the amount of parameter and\\ncomputation when performing width and depth scaling, and\\nused this to design the corresponding model scaling method.\\n3', metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\Yolo7.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Figure 3: Model scaling for concatenation-based models. From (a) to (b), we observe that when depth scaling is performed on\\nconcatenation-based models, the output width of a computational block also increases. This phenomenon will cause the input width\\nof the subsequent transmission layer to increase. Therefore, we propose (c), that is, when performing model scaling on concatenation-\\nbased models, only the depth in a computational block needs to be scaled, and the remaining of transmission layer is performed with\\ncorresponding width scaling.\\nThe above methods are mainly used in architectures such as\\nPlainNet or ResNet. When these architectures are in execut-\\ning scaling up or scaling down, the in-degree and out-degree\\nof each layer will not change, so we can independently an-\\nalyze the impact of each scaling factor on the amount of\\nparameters and computation. However, if these methods\\nare applied to the concatenation-based architecture, we will\\nﬁnd that when scaling up or scaling down is performed on\\ndepth, the in-degree of a translation layer which is immedi-\\nately after a concatenation-based computational block will\\ndecrease or increase, as shown in Figure 3 (a) and (b).\\nIt can be inferred from the above phenomenon that\\nwe cannot analyze different scaling factors separately for\\na concatenation-based model but must be considered to-\\ngether. Take scaling-up depth as an example, such an ac-\\ntion will cause a ratio change between the input channel and\\noutput channel of a transition layer, which may lead to a de-\\ncrease in the hardware usage of the model. Therefore, we\\nmust propose the corresponding compound model scaling\\nmethod for a concatenation-based model. When we scale\\nthe depth factor of a computational block, we must also cal-\\nculate the change of the output channel of that block. Then,\\nwe will perform width factor scaling with the same amount\\nof change on the transition layers, and the result is shown\\nin Figure 3 (c). Our proposed compound scaling method\\ncan maintain the properties that the model had at the initial\\ndesign and maintains the optimal structure.\\n4. Trainable bag-of-freebies\\n4.1. Planned re-parameterized convolution\\nAlthough RepConv [13] has achieved excellent perfor-\\nmance on the VGG [68], when we directly apply it to\\nResNet [26] and DenseNet [32] and other architectures,\\nits accuracy will be signiﬁcantly reduced. We use gradi-\\nent ﬂow propagation paths to analyze how re-parameterized\\nconvolution should be combined with different network.\\nWe also designed planned re-parameterized convolution ac-\\ncordingly.\\nFigure 4: Planned re-parameterized model. In the proposed\\nplanned re-parameterized model, we found that a layer with resid-\\nual or concatenation connections, its RepConv should not have\\nidentity connection. Under these circumstances, it can be replaced\\nby RepConvN that contains no identity connections.\\nRepConv actually combines 3×3convolution, 1×1\\nconvolution, and identity connection in one convolutional\\nlayer. After analyzing the combination and correspond-\\ning performance of RepConv and different architectures,\\nwe ﬁnd that the identity connection in RepConv destroys\\nthe residual in ResNet and the concatenation in DenseNet,\\nwhich provides more diversity of gradients for different fea-\\nture maps. For the above reasons, we use RepConv with-\\nout identity connection (RepConvN) to design the architec-\\nture of planned re-parameterized convolution. In our think-\\ning, when a convolutional layer with residual or concate-\\nnation is replaced by re-parameterized convolution, there\\nshould be no identity connection. Figure 4 shows an exam-\\nple of our designed “planned re-parameterized convolution”\\nused in PlainNet and ResNet. As for the complete planned\\nre-parameterized convolution experiment in residual-based\\nmodel and concatenation-based model, it will be presented\\nin the ablation study session.\\n4', metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\Yolo7.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Figure 5: Coarse for auxiliary and ﬁne for lead head label assigner. Compare with normal model (a), the schema in (b) has auxiliary head.\\nDifferent from the usual independent label assigner (c), we propose (d) lead head guided label assigner and (e) coarse-to-ﬁne lead head\\nguided label assigner. The proposed label assigner is optimized by lead head prediction and the ground truth to get the labels of training\\nlead head and auxiliary head at the same time. The detailed coarse-to-ﬁne implementation method and constraint design details will be\\nelaborated in Apendix.\\n4.2. Coarse for auxiliary and ﬁne for lead loss\\nDeep supervision [38] is a technique that is often used\\nin training deep networks. Its main concept is to add\\nextra auxiliary head in the middle layers of the network,\\nand the shallow network weights with assistant loss as the\\nguide. Even for architectures such as ResNet [26] and\\nDenseNet [32] which usually converge well, deep supervi-\\nsion [70, 98, 67, 47, 82, 65, 86, 50] can still signiﬁcantly\\nimprove the performance of the model on many tasks. Fig-\\nure 5 (a) and (b) show, respectively, the object detector ar-\\nchitecture “without” and “with” deep supervision. In this\\npaper, we call the head responsible for the ﬁnal output as\\nthe lead head, and the head used to assist training is called\\nauxiliary head.\\nNext we want to discuss the issue of label assignment. In\\nthe past, in the training of deep network, label assignment\\nusually refers directly to the ground truth and generate hard\\nlabel according to the given rules. However, in recent years,\\nif we take object detection as an example, researchers often\\nuse the quality and distribution of prediction output by the\\nnetwork, and then consider together with the ground truth to\\nuse some calculation and optimization methods to generate\\na reliable soft label [61, 8, 36, 99, 91, 44, 43, 90, 20, 17, 42].\\nFor example, YOLO [61] use IoU of prediction of bounding\\nbox regression and ground truth as the soft label of object-\\nness. In this paper, we call the mechanism that considers\\nthe network prediction results together with the ground truth\\nand then assigns soft labels as “label assigner.”\\nDeep supervision needs to be trained on the target ob-\\njectives regardless of the circumstances of auxiliary head or\\nlead head. During the development of soft label assigner re-\\nlated techniques, we accidentally discovered a new deriva-\\ntive issue, i.e., “How to assign soft label to auxiliary head\\nand lead head ?” To the best of our knowledge, the relevant\\nliterature has not explored this issue so far. The results of\\nthe most popular method at present is as shown in Figure 5\\n(c), which is to separate auxiliary head and lead head, and\\nthen use their own prediction results and the ground truthto execute label assignment. The method proposed in this\\npaper is a new label assignment method that guides both\\nauxiliary head and lead head by the lead head prediction.\\nIn other words, we use lead head prediction as guidance to\\ngenerate coarse-to-ﬁne hierarchical labels, which are used\\nfor auxiliary head and lead head learning, respectively. The\\ntwo proposed deep supervision label assignment strategies\\nare shown in Figure 5 (d) and (e), respectively.\\nLead head guided label assigner is mainly calculated\\nbased on the prediction result of the lead head and the\\nground truth, and generate soft label through the optimiza-\\ntion process. This set of soft labels will be used as the tar-\\nget training model for both auxiliary head and lead head.\\nThe reason to do this is because lead head has a relatively\\nstrong learning capability, so the soft label generated from it\\nshould be more representative of the distribution and corre-\\nlation between the source data and the target. Furthermore,\\nwe can view such learning as a kind of generalized residual\\nlearning. By letting the shallower auxiliary head directly\\nlearn the information that lead head has learned, lead head\\nwill be more able to focus on learning residual information\\nthat has not yet been learned.\\nCoarse-to-ﬁne lead head guided label assigner also\\nused the predicted result of the lead head and the ground\\ntruth to generate soft label. However, in the process we gen-\\nerate two different sets of soft label, i.e., coarse label and\\nﬁne label, where ﬁne label is the same as the soft label gen-\\nerated by lead head guided label assigner, and coarse label\\nis generated by allowing more grids to be treated as posi-\\ntive target by relaxing the constraints of the positive sample\\nassignment process. The reason for this is that the learning\\nability of an auxiliary head is not as strong as that of a lead\\nhead, and in order to avoid losing the information that needs\\nto be learned, we will focus on optimizing the recall of aux-\\niliary head in the object detection task. As for the output\\nof lead head, we can ﬁlter the high precision results from\\nthe high recall results as the ﬁnal output. However, we must\\nnote that if the additional weight of coarse label is close to\\n5', metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\Yolo7.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

Experimental setup\\nWe use Microsoft COCO dataset to conduct experiments\\nand validate our object detection method. All our experi-\\nments did not use pre-trained models. That is, all models\\nwere trained from scratch. During the development pro-\\ncess, we used train 2017 set for training, and then used val\\n2017 set for veriﬁcation and choosing hyperparameters. Fi-\\nnally, we show the performance of object detection on the\\ntest 2017 set and compare it with the state-of-the-art object\\ndetection algorithms. Detailed training parameter settings\\nare described in Appendix.\\nWe designed basic model for edge GPU, normal GPU,\\nand cloud GPU, and they are respectively called YOLOv7-\\ntiny, YOLOv7, and YOLOv7-W6. At the same time, we\\nalso use basic model for model scaling for different ser-\\nvice requirements and get different types of models. For\\nYOLOv7, we do stack scaling on neck, and use the pro-\\nposed compound scaling method to perform scaling-up of\\nthe depth and width of the entire model, and use this to ob-\\ntain YOLOv7-X. As for YOLOv7-W6, we use the newly\\nproposed compound scaling method to obtain YOLOv7-E6\\nand YOLOv7-D6. In addition, we use the proposed E-\\nELAN for YOLOv7-E6, and thereby complete YOLOv7-\\nE6E. Since YOLOv7-tiny is an edge GPU-oriented archi-\\ntecture, it will use leaky ReLU as activation function. As\\nfor other models we use SiLU as activation function. We\\nwill describe the scaling factor of each model in detail in\\nAppendix.\\n6', metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\Yolo7.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

Our approach is to\\nconnect auxiliary head after one of the sets of feature map\\nbefore merging cardinality, and this connection can make\\nthe weight of the newly generated set of feature map not\\ndirectly updated by assistant loss. Our design allows each\\npyramid of lead head to still get information from objects\\nwith different sizes.

Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the evolving process\\nof object detection methods generates new research top-\\nics. During the research process, we found the replace-\\nment problem of re-parameterized module and the alloca-\\ntion problem of dynamic label assignment. To solve the\\nproblem, we propose the trainable bag-of-freebies method\\nto enhance the accuracy of object detection. Based on the\\nabove, we have developed the YOLOv7 series of object de-\\ntection systems, which receives the state-of-the-art results.\\n7.

Introduction\\nReal-time object detection is a very important topic in\\ncomputer vision, as it is often a necessary component in\\ncomputer vision systems. For example, multi-object track-\\ning [94, 93], autonomous driving [40, 18], robotics [35, 58],\\nmedical image analysis [34, 46], etc. The computing de-\\nvices that execute real-time object detection is usually some\\nmobile CPU or GPU, as well as various neural processing\\nunits (NPU) developed by major manufacturers. For exam-\\nple, the Apple neural engine (Apple), the neural compute\\nstick (Intel), Jetson AI edge devices (Nvidia), the edge TPU\\n(Google), the neural processing engine (Qualcomm), the AI\\nprocessing unit (MediaTek), and the AI SoCs (Kneron), are\\nall NPUs. Some of the above mentioned edge devices focus\\non speeding up different operations such as vanilla convolu-\\ntion, depth-wise convolution, or MLP operations. In this pa-\\nper, the real-time object detector we proposed mainly hopes\\nthat it can support both mobile GPU and GPU devices from\\nthe edge to the cloud.\\nIn recent years, the real-time object detector is still de-\\nveloped for different edge device. For example, the devel-\\nFigure 1: Comparison with other real-time object detectors, our\\nproposed methods achieve state-of-the-arts performance.\\nopment of MCUNet [49, 48] and NanoDet [54] focused on\\nproducing low-power single-chip and improving the infer-\\nence speed on edge CPU. As for methods such as YOLOX\\n[21] and YOLOR [81], they focus on improving the infer-\\nence speed of various GPUs. More recently, the develop-\\nment of real-time object detector has focused on the de-\\nsign of efﬁcient architecture. As for real-time object de-\\ntectors that can be used on CPU [54, 88, 84, 83], their de-\\nsign is mostly based on MobileNet [28, 66, 27], ShufﬂeNet\\n[92, 55], or GhostNet [25]. Another mainstream real-time\\nobject detectors are developed for GPU [81, 21, 97], they\\nmostly use ResNet [26], DarkNet [63], or DLA [87], and\\nthen use the CSPNet [80] strategy to optimize the architec-\\nture. The development direction of the proposed methods in\\nthis paper are different from that of the current mainstream\\nreal-time object detectors. In addition to architecture op-\\ntimization, our proposed methods will focus on the opti-\\nmization of the training process. Our focus will be on some\\noptimized modules and optimization methods which may\\nstrengthen the training cost for improving the accuracy of\\nobject detection, but without increasing the inference cost.\\nWe call the proposed modules and optimization methods\\ntrainable bag-of-freebies.\\n1arXiv:2207.02696v1  [cs.CV]  6 Jul 2022', metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\Yolo7.pdf', 'page': 0})"
